# Stride - Basic Layout + Element Positioning with CSS

### Description
Stride is a start-up looking to build a web platform to connect roommates of similar interests and compatible lifestyles. They are looking to build a web application similar to Airbnb, but that is based on successful long-term roommate arrangements. They have assembled a backend team to create the business logic, database, and API for the mobile application, and they are now looking for a front-end developer to build a sample static page of the designer's mockup.

### Objectives

#### Learning Objectives
After completing this assignment you should:
- Recognize sensible nesting of HTML elements
- Use CSS classes for styling elements on the page.
- Have familiarity with the syntax for common CSS properties like `font-family`, `font-size`, `color`, `background`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, `border-radius`, `text-align`, and `line-height`.
- Understand the different kinds of display types for an HTML:
  + `block`
  + `inline-block`
  + `inline`
- Understand the CSS box-model with respect to `border`, `padding`, `margin`
- Understand how to use CSS positioning for precise placement of elements
  + `fixed`
  + `absolute`
  + `relative`


#### Performance Objectives
To receive a passing grade on this assignment, you must
- Create a static web page that links to a `.css` stylesheet
- Create a faithful representation of the design-mockup with respect to fonts, colors + spacing.
- Have content displayed in multiple columns where shown per the mockup.
- Utilize the `position` property to manipulate the positioning of:
  + the heart in the upper-right corner of the room-listing example
  + the price in bottom-left corner of the room-listing example
  + the arrow tab for the *Got Questions* chat box.

## Deliverables
- an `index.html` file with the content
- a `style.css` file
- a repository on github titled `basic-layout-and-positioning-stride`

## Setup

Create the assignment-folder and download the images into the assignment-folder.

```sh
cd ~/TIY/assignments
mkdir assignment-04
cd assignment-04
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-Charleston-Front-End-Engineering/Course-Guide/master/assignments/basic-layout-and-positioning-stride/images.zip > images.zip
```

Inside of the `assignment-04/` directory you will need to:
+ create the `index.html`
+ `style.css` file in a `css/` folder
+  link the `index.html` file to the `style.css`

**NOTE:** At the top of your stylesheet make sure you apply the style rule `box-sizing: border-box` to *all* elements

```css
* {
    box-sizing: border-box
}
```

- for the background image on the *Find Roommates You Like*, you will need to add the folowing CSS properties to :
+ `background-image: url(../images/hero-splash')`
+ `background-size: cover`

(Note: you do not use an `<img>` tag for an element with a background-image, you put  )

## Epic Mode

Use media-queries (CSS `@media` rule) so that the site works on mobile devices and at the full wide-screen desktop.
