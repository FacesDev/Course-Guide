# Project Proposal
> Failing to plan is planning to fail.

### Breaking Down the Project Proposal

Before starting on a large project with a short deadline, it will be useful to make a comprehensive **Project Proposal** that outlines the scope of your project and addresses major areas of concern before you start to build.

The Project Proposal is composed of 3 principal parts: 
1. The Overview
2. User Stories
3. Data Model

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EamcZXAl-AZSWbB6v2hHw6feJh-T0u35TqVRmJpMOyU/edit?usp=sharing): 

### I. The Overview
The overview is a summary of *what* you are looking build. In includes:
- Name of the App
- Type of App
- Description
- Technologies
- App Features (MVP requirements)
- Project Roadmap (future requirements)

### II. User Stories
User Stories answer the question about *who* your app is being built for. **Feature requirements should be driven by User Stories**

A User Story has the following format:
> **As a ** ________,  **I need a way to** _______ , **so that I can ** _________.

Example: **As an** *authenticated user*, **I need a way to** *arrive at a dashboard page*, **so that I can** *see which todo items I've completed*.

It is incumbent on you to come up with sensible User Stories and to be able to identify feature requirements for desired functionality. Within every user story, you must also identify assumptions that suggest *auxiliary functionality* that needs would need to be in place to build the required feature set.  

### III. Data Model
Your data model is setup by the backend. You should have an explicit understanding of how data is associated and related in your application.


### Deliverables after Day 1
1. Create **at least 5** user stories that outline how users will interact with your application. I recommend doing this first.

2. Create *The Overview* section that describes your application and lists the information outlined above.

Here is an [example-demo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0H1cVlhwlCcSuNwWOid_d2OraZHopdi3nCfChBpGco/edit?usp=sharing) of what I am expecting. You may want to make a copy of this Google Doc to share among your group and edit the information accordingly.

### Deliverables after Day 2
1. The remaining user stories

2. Features your application will require to implement in order to satisfy the user stories

3. Wireframes for your user stories + features that give a rough sketch of the UI/UX of your application.
